What is flixel-gdx?
-----------------------

flixel-gdx is a port of the AS3 game framework [flixel](http://flixel.org) to Java and Andorid. It’s built on top of the well-known libgdx framework which allows apps to be deployed to both Android and Desktop. With libgdx the nasty OpenGL ES stuff is all hidden. Like the original flixel, its primary function is to provide some useful base classes that you can easily extend to make your own basic game objects.
